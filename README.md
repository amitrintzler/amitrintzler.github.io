This repository hosts Amit Rintzler's personal landing page. The site is a single-page layout built with HTML5 and CSS3 and contains the following sections:

- Hero header with photo, headline and social links
- About section highlighting experience and skills
- Projects section
- Contact form for reaching out

The page is responsive and designed to work well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
